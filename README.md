In this section exploring some important topics-
<ul>
<li> Set up a webserver with Express
<li> Serve static Assets
<li> Use Hanlebars to render templates (hbs) 
<li> Send back JSON data
<li> Using Partials with HBS
</ul>

## API used - 
<ul>
  <li> <a href = 'https://weatherstack.com/' >weatherstack</a> - To fetch forecast data
  <li> <a href = 'https://www.mapbox.com/' > mapbox</a> - To fetch geocodes for the address
 </ul>  
 
## Module required -
<ul>
<li> express
<li> hbs
<li> path
</ul>

Covered a lot of new information and explored Express - learning how we can serve up JSON and HTML, serve up the contents of entire directories or working with templating engines.
Also integrated Async code from weather-app into express allowing us to fetch the forecast for an address inside the browser.
