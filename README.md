# Weather-applicatition

<a href="https://heyprashant-weather-app.herokuapp.com/"> Live demo </a>

## *Features include:*
- fetch forecast for any location
- fetch forecast for current location using single button

Covered a lot of new information and explored Node.js, Express - learning how we can serve up JSON and HTML, serve up the contents of entire directories or working with templating engines.

### *API used:*  
<ul>
  <li> <a href = 'https://weatherstack.com/' >weatherstack</a> - To fetch forecast data
  <li> <a href = 'https://www.mapbox.com/' > mapbox</a> - To fetch geocodes for the address
 </ul>  

Also integrated Async code from weather-app into express allowing us to fetch the forecast for an address inside the browser. 
Application is deployed on Heroku.

### *Running locally in your machine:*
To get started, just clone the repository and run ```npm install```:
```
git clone https://github.com/heyprashant/weather-application.git
